gauss-jordan row reduction

- gaussian elimination and all entries above pivot entry equal zero
---
reduced row echelon form

- first nonzero entry of each row equal 1
- first nonzero entry of each successive row equal larger column index
- all entries below first nonzero entry of each row equal 0
- all entries above first nonzero entry of each row equal 0
- rows with all zeros are the final rows of matrix
---
homogeneous system of linear equations

- constant matrix equal zero matrix
---
homogeneous system of linear equations formula

$$
\begin{align*}
AX = 0 \\
A = \text{cofficient matrix} \\
X = \text{variable matrix} \\
0 = \text{constant matrix}
\end{align*}
$$
---
heterogeneous solution set

- if there exists pivot entry for every column then single solution
- if there exists row with all zeros except final entry then zero solutions
- if there exists nonpivot column then infinite solutions
---
homogeneous solution set

- if every column equal pivot column then every solution equal trivial solution
- if there exists nonpivot column then there exists nontrivial solution
---
trivial solution

- every solution equal zero
---
nontrivial solution

- there exists nonzero solution
---
fundamental solution of system of linear equations

- single independent variable equal 1 and remaining variables equal 0
- number of independent variables equal number of fundamental solutions
---
fundamental solution set

- set of linearly independent n-vectors such that every solution of system of linear equations expressible as linear combination of these n-vectors
---
fundamental solution set formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\{\sum_i^k c_i\vec x_i | c \in \mathbb R\} \\
i = \text{independent variable index} \\
k = \text{number of independent variables} \\
c = \text{scalar} \\
\vec x = \text{vector}
\end{align*}
$$
---
simultaneous matrix

- combine augmented matrices with same coefficient matrices but different constant matrices 
---
simultaneous matrix formula

$$
\begin{align*}
A | B | B' = \left[\begin{array}{cccc|c|c}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} & b_{1} & b_{1}' \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} & b_{2} & b_{2}' \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} & b_{m} & b_{m}'
\end{array}\right]
\end{align*}
$$
---
size property

- for collection of $m$ linear equations, each with linear combination of the same $n$ variables, if $m = n$ then every solution equal trivial solution
- for collection of $m$ linear equations, each with linear combination of the same $n$ variables, if $m < n$ then there exists nontrivial solution and therefore infinite solutions
