scalar component formula

$$
\begin{align*}
F_x = F \cos (\theta) \\
F_y = F \sin (\theta) \\
F = \text{force} \\

free body diagram

- draw body as the origin of coordinate system
- sketch all forces acting on the body as vectors
- resolve all vectors into scalar components
- formulate newtons 2nd law for all scalar components
- equilibrium equal $\sum F = 0$ 
- non equilibrium equal $\sum F = ma$

newtons first law

- object at rest remains at rest or in motion with constant velocity unless net external force act on object
---
newtons 1st formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow F_{net} = 0 \rightarrow \frac{d\overrightarrow v}{dt} = 0 \\
F = \text{force} \\
v = \text{velocity} \\
t = \text{time}
\end{align*}

newtons second law

- acceleration dependent mass and amount of net external force acting on mass
---
newtons 2nd formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow F_{net} = m\overrightarrow a =

\end{cases} \\
m = \text{mass} \\
a = \text{acceleration} \\
F_x = \text{x scalar component} \\

---
newtons third law

- for every action force there exists equal and opposite reaction force
- equal magnitude and opposite direction
---
newtons 3rd formula

$$
