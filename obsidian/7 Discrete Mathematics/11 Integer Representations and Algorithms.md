---
### base conversion formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
n = bq + r \\
b = \text{base} \\
q = \text{quotient} \\
r = \text{remainder}

### calculate base conversion
- integer *n* division with base *b* equal quotient
- integer *n* subtraction base *b* multiplication with quotient *q* equal remainder *r*
- repeat until quotient zero
- base conversion equal descending remainder

---
### calculate modular exponentiation
- base 2 expansion of integer *n* 
- result equal 1
- if exponent equal 0 then square result
- if exponent equal 1 then result multiplication with base
- operate modulus
- repeat until exponent zero
