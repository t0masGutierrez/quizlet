subject

- independent variable of the statement
---
predicate

- property that the subject of the statement can posses
---
proposition function

- expression containing variables that become proposition once variables assign value or bound by quantifier
---
proposition formula

$$
\begin{align*}
P(x) = p \\
x = \text{subject} \\
p = \text{proposition} \\
P = \text{predicate}
\end{align*}
$$
---
domain of discourse

- range of elements that proposition function may accept
---
finite domain of discourse

- universal quantification expressible as conjunction of finite predicates
- existential quantification expressible as disjunction of finite predicates
---
quantification

- express the extent of predicate truth over range of elements
- truth dependent on domain of discourse

---
universal quantification

- predicate true for all elements in the domain of discourse
---
universal quantification formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\forall xP(x)
\end{align*}
$$
---
existential quantification

- there exists element in the domain of discourse such that predicate true
---
existential quantification formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\exists xP(x)
\end{align*}
$$
---
uniqueness quantification

- there exists unique element in the domain of discourse such that predicate true
---
uniqueness quantification formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\exists !xP(x)
\end{align*}
$$
---
counterexample

- disprove quantification by providing example where quantifier false
---
precondition

- condition that must be true before the execution of program
---
postcondition

- condition that must be true after the execution of program
---
domain restriction

- restrict domain such that domain of discourse valid if and only if domain meet condition
---
universal domain restriction

- universal quantification of conditional
---
existential domain restriction

- existential quantification of conjunction
---
binding

- association of quantifier with variable
---
scope of quantification

- portion of expression where quantifier bind variable
---
bound variable

- variable inside the scope of quantification or assign value
---
free variable

- variable outside the scope of quantification and not assign value
---
quantifier logical equivalence

- quantifiers that always have the same truth value regardless of predicates and domains of discourse
![[7 Discrete Mathematics/Images/quantifier logical equivalence.png]]
---
quantification nest

- scope of quantification includes multiple quantifiers
![[7 Discrete Mathematics/Images/quantification nest.png]]
---
negation of quantification nest

- switch each quantifier and negate predicate
