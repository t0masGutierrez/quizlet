mean formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum x \\
x = \text{data} \\
n = \text{sample size}
\end{align*}
$$
---
mean frequency formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar x = \frac{\sum fm}{\sum f} \\
f = \text{frequency} \\
m = \text{class midpoint}
\end{align*}
$$
---
weighted frequency formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar x = \frac{\sum fw}{\sum w} \\
f = \text{frequency} \\
w = \text{weight}
\end{align*}
$$
---
median

- middle frequency
---
calculate median

- order data from least to greatest
- select middle data
---
mode

- highest frequency
---
calculate mode

- count
---
measure of spread

- variability of dataset
- range IQR variance and standard deviation
---
5 number summary

![[4 Statistics/Images/5 number summary.png|300]]
---
range

- difference between maximum and minimum
---
interquartile range

- difference between 3rd quartile and 1st quartile
---
variance

- standard deviation squared
---
standard deviation

- mean difference between data and mean
---
empirical rule

- 68% of normal data within 1 standard deviation
- 95% of normal data within 2 standard deviation
- 99.7% of normal data within 3 standard deviation
![[4 Statistics/Images/empirical rule.png|400]]
---
empirical rule of thumb

- two standard deviations equal significantly deviant
---
outlier

- significant deviation from the mean
---
lower outlier formula

$$
\begin{align*}
x_L = \text{Q1} - 1.5 \times \text{IQR} \\
\text{Q1} = \text{1st quartile} \\
\text{IQR} = \text{interquartile range}
\end{align*}
$$
---
upper outlier formula

$$
\begin{align*}
x_U = \text{Q3} + 1.5 \times \text{IQR} \\
\text{Q3} = \text{3rd quartile} \\
\text{IQR} = \text{interquartile range}
\end{align*}
$$
---
measure of position

- location of dataset
- z score quantile and percentile
---
z score

- number of standard deviations from mean
---
z score formula

$$
\begin{align*}
z = \frac{x - \bar x}{s} \\
x = \text{datum} \\
\bar x = \text{mean} \\
s = \text{standard deviation}
\end{align*}
$$
---
quantile

- dataset division into quarters
---
percentile

- dataset division into hundredths
