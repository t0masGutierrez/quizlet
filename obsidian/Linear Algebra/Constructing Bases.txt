spanning basis property

- span simplification require spanning set
- independent test require spanning set
---
span simplification

- generate matrix whose rows equal the vectors of subset of vector space
- form the reduced row echelon of the system
- zero rows of rref equal the redundant vectors of subset
---
basis via span simplification

- span simplification
- vectors of subset corresponding with nonzero rows of rref equal the basis vectors of subset
---
independence test

- generate matrix whose columns equal the vectors of subset of vector space
- form the reduced row echelon of the system
- nonpivot columns of rref equal the redundant vectors of subset
---
basis via independence test

- independence test
- vectors of subset corresponding with pivot columns of rref equal the basis vectors of subset
---
span simplification versus independence test

- vectors equal rows of matrix
- basis not subset of spanning set
- nonzero rows equal basis vectors

independent basis property

- enlargement require linearly independent set
---
basis via enlargement

- form spanning set with standard unit vectors aka identity matrix
- augment linearly independent set with spanning set
- independence test
- vectors of subset corresponding with pivot columns of rref equal the basis vectors of subset
---
spanning versus independence

- vector subtraction equal basis via spanning set
- vector addition equal basis via linearly independent set
---
basis test

- form the reduced row echelon of the system
- if rank equal dimension of vector space then basis
- if rank not equal dimension of vector space then not basis
