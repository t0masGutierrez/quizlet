proposition

- statement thats either true or false but not both
---
propositional variable

truth value

- outcome of proposition
---
compound proposition

- combination of propositions with logical operators
---
logical operator

- not
- and
- or
- xor

equivalent proposition

- conditional equivalent contrapositive
- same truth value under every possible condition
- inverse equivalent converse
---
order of operations

$$
\begin{align*}
1 = \neg \\
2 = \land \\
3 = \lor \\
4 = \rightarrow \\
5 = \leftrightarrow \\
\end{align*}
$$
---
language conversion logic

- identify propositions from language
- assign propositional variables
- apply logical operators
---
system consistency

- if there exist system that satisfy all specifications then system consistent
- if there exist truth values that satisfy all conditionals then proposition consistent
---
tautology

- proposition always true regardless of truth values of propositional variables
---
contradiction

- proposition always false regardless of truth values of propositional variables
---
contingency

- proposition neither always true nor always false
---
logical equivalence

- propositions that satisfy the requirements of tautology
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/logical equivalence.png]]
---
conditional logical equivalence

- conditionals that satisfy the requirements of tautology
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/conditional logical equivalence.png]]
---
biconditional logical equivalence

- biconditionals that satisfy the requirements of tautology
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/biconditional logical equivalence.png]]
---
satisfiable

- proposition true for at least 1 assignment of truth values
---
unsatisfiable

- proposition false for every assignment of truth values
---
truth table

- organization of truth values
---
construct truth table

- number of truth table rows equal 2ⁿ where n equal the number of propositional variables
- alternate every 2ⁿ⁻¹ rows between 0s and 1s for the 1st propositional variable
- alternate every 2ⁿ⁻² rows between 0s and 1s for the 2nd propositional variable
- continue pattern for all propositional variables
