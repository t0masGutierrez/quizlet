boolean algebra

- set ${\{0, 1}\}$ with two binary operations ${\{\land, \lor}\}$ and single unary operation $\{\overline{\ }\}$ such that these hold for all ${\{x, y, z}\}$

---
boolean complement

- opposite of proposition
- not
---
boolean complement formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\overline{1} = 0 \\
\overline{0} = 1
\end{align*}

$$

---
boolean product

- joining of both proposition
- and
---
boolean product formula

$$
\begin{align*}
1 \times 1 = 1 \\
1 \times 0 = 0 \\
0 \times 1 = 0 \\
0 \times 0 = 0
\end{align*}
$$
---
boolean sum

- joining of either proposition
- or
---
boolean sum formula

$$
\begin{align*}
1 + 1 = 1 \\
1 + 0 = 1 \\
0 + 1 = 1 \\
0 + 0 = 0
\end{align*}
$$
---
boolean function

- boolean expression as function of boolean variable(s)
---
boolean function formula

$$
\begin{align*}
f : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\} \\
n = \text{number of variables}
\end{align*}
$$
---
boolean complexity

- number of variable combinations
---
boolean complexity formula

$$
\begin{align*}
N = 2^n \\
n = \text{number of variables}
\end{align*}
$$
---
boolean variable

- variable whose values equal 1 or 0
---
boolean expression

- combination of boolean variables with boolean operators
---
boolean identity

- boolean expression that satisfy the requirements of tautology
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/boolean identity.png]]
---
dual of boolean expression

- interchange products and sums
- interchange 1s and 0s
---
duality principle

- if dual of both sides of boolean expression then boolean identity remains true
---
literal

- boolean variable or complement of boolean variable
---
minterm

- boolean product of literals equal 1
---
sum of products expansion

- represent boolean function as boolean sum of minterms
---
calculate sum of products expansion

- construct truth table
- identify rows where output equal 1
- formulate minterm of rows
- compute boolean sum of minterms
---
maxterm

- boolean sum of literals equal 0
---
product of sums expansion

- represent boolean function as boolean product of maxterms
---
calculate product of sums expansion

- construct truth table
- identify rows where output equal 0
- formulate maxterm of rows
- compute boolean product of maxterms
---
functional completeness

- if every boolean function representable by set of boolean operators then boolean operators functionally complete
---
