tree

- tree if and only if there exists unique simple path between any two vertices
---
tree formula

$$
\begin{align*}
|E| = n - 1 \\
n = \text{number of vertices} \\
|E| = \text{number of edges}
\end{align*}
$$
---
tree graph

- graph that may not contain loops, multiple edges, cycles, or disconnections
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/tree.png|500]]
---
tree graph formula

$$
\begin{align*}
\forall a(a, a) \notin R \\
(a, b) \in R \to (b, a) \notin R \\
(a, b) \in R \land (b, c) \in R \to (a, c) \notin R \\
\forall (e \in E)(e \in R)
\end{align*}
$$
---
forest graph

- collection of disjoint trees

---
root tree graph

- tree graph where single vertex acts as the root and every edge direct away from root
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/root tree.png|400]]
---
parent vertex

- vertex directly above children vertices
---
child vertex

- vertices directly below parent vertex
---
ancestor 

- vertices indirectly above parent vertex including grandparent vertices
---
descendent

- vertices indirectly below parent vertex including grandchildren vertices
---
leaf vertex

- vertex with zero children vertices
---
internal vertex

- vertex with non zero children vertices
---
subtree

- subgraph of tree graph from vertex and its descendent(s)
---
order root tree

- root tree where the children of internal vertex order from left to right
---
N-ary tree

- root tree where every internal vertex has $\le N$ children vertices
---
full N-ary tree

- root tree where every interval vertex has *N* children vertices
---
full N-ary tree formula

$$
\begin{align*}
n \to i = \frac{n - 1}{N} \land l = \frac{(n + 1)(N - 1)}{N} \\
i \to n = Ni + 1 \land l = (N -1)i + 1 \\
l \to n = \frac{Nl - 1}{N - 1} \land i = \frac{l - 1}{N - 1} \\
n = \text{number of vertices} \\
N = \text{number of children vertices} \\
i = \text{number of internal vertices} \\
l = \text{number of leaves}
\end{align*}
$$
---
binary tree

- root tree where every internal vertex has 2 children vertices
![[Discrete Mathematics/Images/binary tree.png|400]]
---
vertex level

- length of path from root vertex
---
tree height

- maximum vertex level
---
tree height upper bound

- if N-ary tree of height *h* then there exists $N^h$ leaves
---
balance N-ary tree

- all leaves of height *h* or $h - 1$ 
---
tree height theorem

- if N-ary tree of height *h* and *l* leaves then $h \ge \lceil log_N (l) \rceil$ 
- if full balance N-ary tree of height *h* and *l* leaves then $h = \lceil log_N (l) \rceil$
